# Parallelized A* Search Algorithm

Through A* search algorithm, I try to learn about parallel computing and GPU programming. The serial version and the parallelized version will be implemented in Python, then compare the performance between them.

Through this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tools-and-libraries-to-leverage-gpu-computing-in-python/), I've found that Python has libraries that can be used to leverage GPU computing. `PyCUDA` and `Numba` provide low-level access to CUDA features but requiring more detailed knowledge of GPU programming.
